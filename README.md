# Railway-Track-Monitoring-Robot
A prototype railway track monitoring and live streaming robot developed for my Bachelor thesis. The system uses Arduino, ultrasonic sensors, and an IP camera for crack detection, real-time video surveillance, and basic track cleaning, aimed at improving railway safety
# Prototype of Railway Track Monitoring and Live Streaming Robot

This repository contains the work from my **Bachelor Thesis Project**:  
**"Prototype of Railway Track Monitoring and Live Streaming Robot"**  
developed at *Guru Nanak Institutions Technical Campus (affiliated to JNTU Hyderabad).*

##  Overview
The Indian Railways faces challenges in track safety due to **cracks, poor maintenance, and delays in inspections**.  
This project proposes an **autonomous robot** capable of:

- Detecting cracks on railway tracks using **ultrasonic sensors**  
- Providing **real-time live video streaming** via an IP camera  
- Cleaning track dust/debris with a **rotating brush mechanism**  
- Controlled remotely using **Bluetooth and Arduino Uno**  
- Designed to be **scalable with GPS/GSM integration** for future upgrades

##  Components Used
- Arduino Uno (ATmega328p)  
- Ultrasonic Sensors (for crack detection)  
- Servo Motors and DC Motors  
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module  
- Wireless IP Camera (for live streaming)  
- Lithium Polymer Battery  
- Mechanical Chassis with Wheels and Cleaning Brush

##  Methodology
1. Robot runs autonomously on tracks.  
2. Ultrasonic sensor detects cracks or obstacles.  
3. IP camera streams live video to monitoring station.  
4. Bluetooth module enables remote control for navigation.  
5. Cleaning brush removes dust and small debris.

##  Results
- Successfully monitored track sections with real-time video feed.  
- Basic cracks were detected using ultrasonic sensors.  
- Demonstrated potential to reduce derailment risks by **early crack detection**.  

---

##  Future Scope
- GPS + GSM module for **automatic location alerts**.  
- Solar power integration for **sustainable operation**.  
- Enhanced sensors (IR, LiDAR) for higher accuracy.  
- Full automation without manual intervention.
